# Insurance Claim DDD Model

This repository contains Domain-Driven Design (DDD) models representing an insurance claim processing system, based on a modeling workshop session.

## Contents

- [Insurance Claim Processing Flow](ddd-insurance-claim-process.md) - The main process flow visualization
- [Domain Model](ddd-domain-model.md) - Details of aggregates, commands, events, and actors
- [Bounded Contexts](ddd-bounded-contexts.md) - Analysis of potential bounded contexts and their relationships

## About This Model

This model was created by extracting and documenting a diagram produced in a Domain-Driven Design modeling workshop. It shows the end-to-end process of insurance claim handling, from submission through assessment to payment or rejection.

## Key DDD Concepts Used

The model demonstrates several core DDD concepts:

  root((DDD Concepts))
    Tactical Design
      Aggregates
      Domain Events
      Commands
      Entities
    Strategic Design
      Bounded Contexts
      Context Mapping
      Ubiquitous Language
    Process Modeling
      Event Storming
      User Roles
      Workflow
```

## Quick Reference

### Domain Event Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Claim Submitted] --> B[Claim Registered]
    B --> C[Assessment Performed]
    C --> D[Claim Accepted/Rejected]
    D --> E[Payment Scheduled]
    E --> F[Payment Performed]
    D --> G[Notification Sent]
    F --> G
```

### User Roles

- **Customer** - Submits claim and receives notifications
- **Administrator** - Verifies documentation completeness  
- **Claims Department Staff** - Performs assessment, makes decisions, schedules payments

## Next Steps

Potential next steps for this model:

1. Refine aggregate boundaries
2. Make decisions on bounded context integration patterns
3. Define services and repositories
4. Create detailed domain models within each bounded context
