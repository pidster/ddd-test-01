# ADR-001: Adoption of Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We are designing an insurance claim processing system based on Domain-Driven Design principles. The system needs to handle complex business processes with multiple bounded contexts, including Claims Processing, Payments, Notifications, and Policy Management.

Key business requirements:
- Support for independent scaling of different parts of the system
- Ability to deploy changes to specific areas without affecting the entire system
- Support for multiple teams working on different parts of the system simultaneously
- High availability and fault isolation

Key technical constraints:
- Need to integrate with existing systems
- Need to support different technology choices for different parts of the system
- Need to handle high volumes of claims during peak periods

## Decision
We will adopt a microservices architecture for the insurance claim processing system, with services aligned to the identified bounded contexts:

1. Claims Service
2. Payment Service
3. Notification Service
4. Policy Service

## Rationale
Microservices architecture aligns well with Domain-Driven Design by allowing us to create autonomous services around bounded contexts.

### Advantages
- **Bounded Context Alignment**: Microservices can be organized around business capabilities and bounded contexts
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies as appropriate
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: Failures in one service have limited impact on others
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work on different services with minimal coordination

### Disadvantages
- **Increased Operational Complexity**: More services to monitor, deploy, and manage
- **Distributed System Challenges**: Network latency, consistency concerns, and distributed transactions
- **Learning Curve**: Requires knowledge of distributed systems and microservices patterns

### Alternatives Considered
- **Monolithic Architecture**
  - Pros: Simpler development and deployment model, easier testing
  - Cons: Tight coupling, challenges with scaling, inability to deploy parts independently
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
  - Pros: Loose coupling, reuse of services
  - Cons: Often relies on heavyweight middleware, can lead to big services

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear boundaries between functional areas
- Ability to evolve each service independently
- Better alignment with DDD principles
- Support for independent team ownership
- Services can be optimized for specific workloads

### Negative
- Increased complexity in deployment and operations
- Need for inter-service communication patterns
- Challenge of maintaining data consistency across services
- Requires more sophisticated monitoring and tracing

### Neutral
- Will need to establish standards for service communication
- Will require investment in CI/CD pipelines
- Teams will need to adapt to distributed systems thinking

## Compliance
- Services must be defined according to bounded contexts
- Each service must have its own database
- Services must communicate through well-defined APIs and events
- Services should be independently deployable
