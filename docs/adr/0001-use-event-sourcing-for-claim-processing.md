# ADR 0001: Use Event Sourcing for Claim Processing

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The insurance claim processing system requires a reliable way to track the full history of a claim throughout its lifecycle. Claims pass through various stages (submitted, reviewed, approved/rejected, paid) and can be modified by multiple stakeholders (customers, claims adjusters, managers). Additionally, audit requirements mandate complete traceability of all changes.

Traditional CRUD-based approaches have limitations in this context:
- They store only the current state, losing historical changes
- They make audit trails difficult to implement consistently
- They don't naturally support temporal queries (e.g., "what was the state of this claim on a specific date?")
- They make it challenging to implement event-driven integrations with other systems

## Decision

We will implement event sourcing for the core claim processing domain. This means:

1. All changes to a claim will be stored as a sequence of immutable events
2. The current state of a claim will be derived by replaying these events
3. Events will be the primary integration mechanism between bounded contexts
4. We will maintain separate read models optimized for query performance

We will use:
- Kafka as our event store and message broker
- PostgreSQL for storing read models and snapshots
- An outbox pattern to ensure reliable event publishing

## Consequences

### Positive

- Complete audit trail of all changes by design
- Ability to reconstruct the state of any claim at any point in time
- Natural fit for event-driven architecture and integration with other systems
- Improved system resilience through event replay capabilities
- Better alignment with domain language (claims naturally progress through events)
- Easier to implement complex business rules that depend on historical context

### Negative

- Increased complexity in system architecture
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with event sourcing
- Potential performance considerations for aggregates with many events
- Need for careful versioning of events as the system evolves
- Additional infrastructure requirements for event store and projections

### Mitigations

- We will implement snapshot mechanisms to improve read performance
- We will create comprehensive documentation and examples
- We will establish clear event schema evolution guidelines
- We will implement proper monitoring for event processing

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional CRUD with audit tables**: Easier to implement but lacks the temporal query capabilities and doesn't align well with the event-driven nature of claim processing.

2. **Event-driven architecture without full event sourcing**: Would provide some benefits of event-driven design but wouldn't maintain the complete event history needed for audit and temporal queries.

3. **Command sourcing**: Records commands rather than events, but this would make projections more complex and doesn't align as well with domain language.
