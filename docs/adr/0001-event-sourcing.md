# ADR-0001: Event Sourcing for Insurance Claims

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Insurance Claims System needs to track the complete history of changes to claims for several reasons:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Insurance claims are subject to regulatory requirements that mandate maintaining a complete audit trail of all changes.
2. **Dispute Resolution**: In case of disputes, we need an accurate historical record to understand the exact sequence of actions that led to a particular state.
3. **Business Intelligence**: Historical data provides valuable insights for improving processes and identifying patterns.
4. **State Reconstruction**: The ability to reconstruct the state of a claim at any point in time is critical for analysis and reporting.

Traditional CRUD-based approaches with mutable state and limited audit logging do not provide the comprehensive history tracking and temporal query capabilities we need.

## Decision

We will implement **Event Sourcing** for the core domain entities within the Insurance Claims System, particularly for the Claim aggregate.

Key aspects of our implementation:

1. **Event Store**: All domain events will be persisted in an append-only store. Each event will include:
   - Unique event ID
   - Timestamp
   - Event type
   - Aggregate ID
   - Event data
   - Version/sequence number

2. **Event Types**: We will define specific event types for all significant state changes, such as:
   - ClaimSubmittedEvent
   - DocumentsAddedEvent
   - ClaimReviewedEvent
   - ClaimApprovedEvent
   - ClaimRejectedEvent
   - PaymentInitiatedEvent
   - PaymentCompletedEvent

3. **Aggregates**: Aggregates will be reconstructed by replaying events from the event store. The current state will be a function of all historical events.

4. **Event Publishing**: Domain events will be published to a message broker (Kafka) for integration with other bounded contexts and for building read models.

5. **Snapshots**: For performance optimization, we will implement snapshots at regular intervals to avoid replaying all events from the beginning.

6. **CQRS**: We will separate command and query responsibilities, using the event-sourced aggregates for commands and specialized read models for queries.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Complete History**: Every state change is captured as an event, providing a complete audit trail and history of all actions.
- **Temporal Queries**: We can reconstruct the state of a claim at any point in time, enabling historical analysis and reporting.
- **Integration**: Events provide a natural integration point for other systems and bounded contexts.
- **Evolvability**: The system can evolve more easily as we can add new event types and update projections without affecting the historical record.
- **Debugging**: Easier debugging and troubleshooting through event replay and analysis.

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Event Sourcing introduces additional complexity compared to traditional CRUD approaches.
- **Learning Curve**: The team will need to adapt to a different programming model.
- **Performance Considerations**: Reading the current state requires replaying events, which can impact performance for aggregates with many events.
- **Schema Evolution**: Care must be taken when evolving event schemas to ensure backward compatibility.

### Mitigations

- **Snapshots**: Implement snapshot creation to mitigate performance issues with event replay.
- **Training**: Provide training and documentation for the team on event sourcing patterns.
- **Event Versioning**: Implement a versioning strategy for events to handle schema evolution.
- **Read Models**: Use specialized read models optimized for specific query patterns.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional CRUD with Audit Logging**: Simpler to implement but lacks the rich history and temporal query capabilities of event sourcing. Audit logs are often an afterthought and don't capture all business-relevant changes.

2. **CQRS without Event Sourcing**: Would provide separation of read and write models but without the benefits of having a complete event history.

3. **Temporal Tables**: Database-level approach to tracking history, but lacking the rich domain semantics and integration capabilities of domain events.
