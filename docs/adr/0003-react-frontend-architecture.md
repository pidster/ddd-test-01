# ADR 0003: React Frontend Architecture for Insurance Claims UI

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our insurance claim processing system requires a modern, responsive, and maintainable user interface for both internal users (claim adjusters, managers) and external users (policyholders). The UI needs to:

1. Handle complex forms with validation for claim submission and processing
2. Display dashboards with real-time updates on claim status
3. Support document uploads and viewing
4. Provide different views and capabilities based on user roles
5. Integrate with RESTful backend services
6. Maintain good performance even with large datasets
7. Allow for future growth and feature additions

We need to decide on a frontend architecture and technology stack that supports these requirements while enabling developer productivity and maintainability.

## Decision

We will build the frontend using React with TypeScript, following a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. Our architecture will include:

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Atomic design pattern (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
   - Shared component library for consistent UI elements
   - Container/presentational component separation where appropriate

2. **State Management**:
   - React Query for server state management (API calls, caching, synchronization)
   - React Context API for global application state
   - Local component state for UI-specific state

3. **Routing**:
   - React Router for navigation and route-based code splitting
   - Protected routes for authorization control

4. **Form Handling**:
   - Formik for form state management and validation
   - Yup for schema-based validation rules

5. **Styling**:
   - Material-UI as our component library
   - CSS-in-JS using Emotion for custom styling

6. **API Communication**:
   - Axios for HTTP requests
   - Centralized API service layer with interceptors for auth and error handling

7. **Testing**:
   - Jest for unit tests
   - React Testing Library for component tests
   - Cypress for end-to-end tests

8. **Code Quality**:
   - ESLint for static code analysis
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - Husky for pre-commit hooks

## Consequences

### Positive

- TypeScript provides type safety and better developer experience
- Component-based architecture allows for reusability and maintainability
- React Query simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- Material-UI provides a consistent design system
- Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand
- Strong testing strategy ensures reliability
- Atomic design pattern provides a scalable structure
- Code quality tools ensure consistent code style

### Negative

- Learning curve for developers new to some of these technologies
- Potential performance concerns with large Material-UI bundles
- Multiple libraries to keep updated and maintained
- More upfront effort to set up the architecture correctly

### Mitigations

- Create comprehensive documentation and examples
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading to improve performance
- Establish consistent upgrade and maintenance schedules
- Create starter templates that encapsulate the architecture decisions

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Next.js Framework**: Offers server-side rendering and simplified routing, but adds complexity we don't need since our backend is already RESTful.

2. **Redux for State Management**: More established but introduces additional complexity compared to React Query and Context API for our needs.

3. **Styled Components**: Alternative to Emotion but with similar capabilities. Emotion chosen for better performance.

4. **Vue.js**: Alternative framework with good documentation but smaller ecosystem and less alignment with team expertise.

5. **Angular**: More opinionated and complete framework but more complex and less flexible for our specific needs.
